#How to use

Clone this repo and then in command line type:

* `npm install` or `yarn` - install all dependencies
* `gulp` - run dev-server and let magic happen, or
* `gulp general` or `gulp production` - build project from sources

## Flags

We have several useful flags.

* `gulp --open` - run dev server and then open preview in browser
* `gulp [task_name] --prod` or `gulp [task_name] --production` - run task in production mode. Some of the tasks (like, sass or js compilation) have additional settings for production mode (such as code minification), so with this flag you can force production mode.
